# Graph
Implementation of an undirected graph as well as graph search algorithms. Connected components is useful for clinets who want to know if there is a path from one vertex to the other; this client query can be answered in constant time using the class connected components - linear time processing using the constructor which allows the query methods to run in constant time.
